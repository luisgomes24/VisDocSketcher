    %% Comments for each node
    %% A represents the initial Excel data source used for training and testing data.
    %% B1 and B2 are the DataFrames created by reading the Excel source.
    %% C1 and C2 are TensorFlow datasets created from the data frames for training and validation.
    %% D represents the data augmentation setup for expanding the training data.
    %% E is the Keras model creation step using a pre-trained Xception network, trained with the training data.
    %% F stores the history of the training process, which includes metrics such as accuracy and loss.
