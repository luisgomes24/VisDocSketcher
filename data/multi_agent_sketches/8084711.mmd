    %% Comments for clarity
    %% Node A represents the data source - a CSV file containing features and the target variable
    %% Node B represents the DataFrame that reads the CSV data for further processing
    %% The df_nodes subgraph represents the data variables used in the notebook
    %% Node C represents the logistic regression model, highlighting its role and dependencies
    %% Node E depicts the visual representation of scores using a scatter plot
    %% Node G shows where predictions from the model are made and evaluated in node H
