    %% Node for the initial file ID list definition
    A["File ID List"] -->|"Defines file IDs for models"| B["Variable: fid"]
    
    %% Node for downloading model files
    B -->|"Used to generate download link"| C["wget download"]

    %% Node that represents each downloaded model
    C -->|"Downloads model file"| D["Model File: pytorch_model_0.bin"]

    %% Node for the PyTorch model demarcation
    D -->|"Is loaded into"| E["Model: PyTorch"]

    %% Node representing for loop for downloading all models
    F["For Loop Index: i"] -->|"Controls downloading process"| C

    
    %% Comments for nodes
    %% A: Represents the list of file IDs for the models to be downloaded
    %% B: 'fid' variable used to hold the current file ID in each download iteration
    %% C: Action of downloading the model file using wget
    %% D: Represents the model file downloaded from Google Drive
    %% E: Node demarcating that the file serves as a PyTorch model
    %% F: Represents the loop index variable controlling the downloading of multiple files
