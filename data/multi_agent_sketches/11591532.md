# Diagram sketch of workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
    Load content and style images from specified sources.

2. **Model Initialization**  
    Initialize VGG19 model without classifier for feature extraction.  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
    Extract content and style features from images using VGG19.

4. **Gram Matrix Calculation**  
    Calculate gram matrices for style features for loss computation.

5. **Image Transformation**  
    Iterate to modify the target image to minimize loss based on content and style weights.

6. **Output Visualization**  
    Display and compare the content image and the final stylized image.
