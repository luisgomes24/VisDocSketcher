    %% Node Comments
    %% A: This node represents the CSV data source containing Chinese handwritten digits.
    %% B: This node is the DataFrame that holds the entire dataset loaded from the CSV.
    %% C: This node represents the 80% sample of the dataset used for training models.
    %% D: This node represents the 20% of data reserved for testing model predictions.
    %% E: This node lists extracted numeric features used in modeling.
    %% F: This node represents the setup process in PyCaret where data preprocessing is configured.
    %% G: This node represents the stage where PyCaret trains various models.
    %% H: This node represents the final evaluation and prediction using the trained models on unseen data.
    
    %% Transition Comments
    %% A to B: Load the dataset from CSV into a DataFrame.
    %% B to C: Sample 80% of the data for model training.
    %% B to D: Extract remaining 20% of the data for model evaluation.
    %% C to E: Select and prepare numeric features for input to models.
    %% E to F: Initialize PyCaret's setup with selected features.
    %% C to F: Feed sampled training data into the PyCaret setup.
    %% F to G: Train models using the configured setup.
    %% D to H: Evaluate model performance on unseen data.
