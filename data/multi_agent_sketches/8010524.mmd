%% The diagram captures the data sources, preparation, model preparation, and prediction stages of the workflow
%% DataSources - Represents the data files being read
%% DataPreparation - Represents the merging, transformation into features and target
%% ModelPreparation - Represents the data splitting and model training processes
%% Predictions - Represents the prediction and evaluation of the model's output
