    %% Node for data source a
    A[a: List Initialization] --> |List Operations| B[b: Mixed Type List]
    A --> C
    %% Node for data source b
    B --> |Indexing & Removal| C[Tuple c: Conversion]
    %% Node for variable c
    C --> |Convert to List| D[d: List Result]
    %% Node for variable d
    D --> |Used for Tuple & List Operations| A
```

%% Explanation:
%% A: Represents list 'a', initialized as empty and operated on.
%% B: Represents list 'b', initialized with mixed data types.
%% C: Represents tuple 'c', which is converted to a list 'd'.
%% D: Represents list 'd', created from tuple 'c', used for list operations.
