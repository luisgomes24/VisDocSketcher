    %% Comments for clarification
    %% A: Represents the source of the data - Images for classification.
    %% B: Represents DataLoader with training and validation datasets.
    %% C: Learner object - It abstracts the model details and training methods.
    %% D: The training model based on ResNet34 architecture.
    %% E: Interpretation of model results, accuracy, losses.
    %% F: Visualization of the learned model's predictions.
    %% H: Final output model stored for future inference.
