# Workflow Diagram for Tomato Plant Health Classification Notebook

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the steps for predicting the health of tomato plants using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Steps of the Workflow
1. **Import Libraries**: Essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib are imported.
2. **Load Model**: A pre-trained CNN model is loaded from an H5 file.
3. **Load Class Names**: Class names for plant health are loaded and cleaned.
4. **Prediction Function**: A function "Tester" is defined to make predictions based on input images and the loaded model.
5. **Make Predictions**: The model is tested with multiple images of tomato plants to predict their health.

## Components
- **Data Sources**: 
   - Model: /kaggle/input/home-grown-tomato-plants/TomatoHealth.h5
   - Class names: /kaggle/input/home-grown-tomato-plants/classNames.txt
   - Test images: Various images from a specified validation folder.

- **Data Variables**: 
   - MyCnn: Loaded pre-trained CNN model.
   - classNames: List of class names for predictions.

- **Main Functions**: 
   - Tester(imgPath, model): Function to predict and visualize the health of tomato plants based on input images.

- **Models**:
   - Pre-trained CNN model used for classification of tomato plant health based on input images.
