    A[train.csv] -->|Read CSV file| B[train_csv]
    %% train.csv serves as a source for injury data
    B -->|Explore data and count injuries| C[organ_counts]
    %% organ_counts is derived from train_csv for visualization purposes
    subgraph DICOMProcessing
        D[DICOM Images] -->|Select file| E[image_file]
        %% image_file is a single DICOM file selected from the DICOM Images directory
        E -->|Read DICOM image| F[ds]
        %% ds represents the DICOM image data read into the workflow
        F -->|Extract pixel data| sample_vid
        %% sample_vid holds pixel data for selected DICOM images
    end
    sample_vid -->|Visualize| G[Animation of samples]
    %% sample_vid is visualized to show appearance of DICOM images
    B -->|Visualize injury counts| C
    %% organ_counts is visualized to show the distribution of injuries
    B --> H[train_list]
    %% train_list is used to loop through DICOM images for preprocessing
    H -->|Preprocess images| I[Batch Processing]
    %% train_list processes batches of DICOM images
