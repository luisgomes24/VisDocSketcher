    %% Node for data generation
    make_data["make_data() function"]
    make_data --> X & y & X2 & y2

    %% Node for ML model
    model["Polynomial Regression | Degrees: 1 to 8"]
    X & y --> model
    model --> tr_score & te_score

    %% Predictions plotting
    model --> xf

    %% Data plotting
    plt["Matplotlib Plotting"]
    X & y & X2 & y2 & model & xf --> plt

    %% Comments explaining each component
    %% X: Input feature array is generated using the make_data() function
    %% y: Target outputs are calculated from X with noise addition
    %% xf: Represents points used for plotting predictions
    %% Model: Polynomial regression model trained on X, y
    %% tr_score & te_score: Lists storing training and testing scores, respectively.
    %% matplotlib: Visualization of data flows and model predictions
