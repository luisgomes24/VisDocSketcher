    %% Node for Antecedent: Quality
    quality["Quality (0-10)"]
    note for quality: Antecedent variable representing the quality score

    %% Node for Antecedent: Service
    service["Service (0-10)"]
    note for service: Antecedent variable representing the service score

    %% Node for Fuzzy Logic Control System
    flcs[["Fuzzy Logic Control System"]]
    note for flcs: System using defined rules for tip calculation

    %% Node for Consequent: Tip
    tip["Tip (0-25)"]
    note for tip: Consequent variable representing the tip amount

    %% Node for Control System Simulation
    tipping[["Control System Simulation: tipping"]]
    note for tipping: Executes compute method to evaluate output

    flcs --> rule1
    note for rule1: 
        "1. If quality is poor or service is poor, then tip is low
         2. If service is average, then tip is medium
         3. If service is good or quality is good, then tip is high"
