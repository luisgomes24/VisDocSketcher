    A[imagelist.csv] -->|Read CSV| B[df1]
    %% Node A represents the data source: imagelist.csv
    %% Node B represents the DataFrame df1 created from the CSV file

    B -->|Data Preview| C[Display df1.head()]
    %% Node C represents the operation of displaying the head of the DataFrame

    B -->|Distribution Plot| D[plotPerColumnDistribution]
    %% Node D represents the analysis step for plotting distribution per column

    B -->|Correlation Matrix| E[plotCorrelationMatrix]
    %% Node E represents the analysis step for plotting the correlation matrix

    B -->|Scatter Matrix| F[plotScatterMatrix]
    %% Node F represents the analysis step for plotting the scatter matrix

    %% This workflow describes the sequence of data processing and analysis steps starting from reading the CSV to various data visualizations without ML models.
