    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone has put you in a very large facility with a very large number of cells. All these cells open from the outside. You are on the inside. This state of affairs is arguably suboptimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: You've gained access to the control panel for the cells on the other side of your hallway. At least some of them have other fleshy meatbags like yourself that might be willing to help you in your escape, or at least serve as distractions.  You can't open your own cell, but you can open theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad news:  You can't see inside the cells.  Any cells that don't have squishy lumps of talking protein have murderbots. Murderbots that enter fits of insane violent rage when provoked (provocations include: seeing the murderbot, being seen by the murderbot, thinking too hard about not being seen by a murderbot, producing heat in excess of ambient room temperature, or consuming more oxygen than the facility average for inanimate objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "More good news: You *can* see the occupants of some cells on a few other hallways, and you can see environmental information for all of the cells everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "More bad news: If you open the wrong cell doors you and all of the other lumps of inexplicably thinking meat are *definitely* going to get murderbotted. Hard. All over the walls and doors and ceiling and the floor. In an exciting number of very small pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the provided environmental information to decide which occupants of the corresponding cells to release.  The flag will be a string of 1 and 0 values, where a '1' means 'open this door' and a 0 means 'please do not release the murderbot'.  If, for instance, there were 20 cells and you wanted to releast the first three, the sixth, and seventh cell, your flag would look like this: `11100110000000000000`\n",
    "\n",
    "Release at least 10 humans and exactly 0 murderbots to collect the flag.  You do *not* have to release all the humans: 10 is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `murderbots/train_data.json` has environmental information for cells not on your floor and `murderbots/train_labels.json` contains the information about their occupants -- `1` is a disgusting primate, `0` is a pure and perfect killing machine of chrome and steel.  The file `murderbots/test_data.json` has the environmental information about cells on your block."
