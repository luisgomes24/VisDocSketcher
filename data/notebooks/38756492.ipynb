    "CACHED is an object detection model for charts. It gives bounding boxes for chat elements, title, tick labels, etc. Since I had hard times running this model, I share the compiled packages. This notebook is just about the systems (compile, install and run), and not about machine learning. I didn't train for this competition and all the data are unchanged from authors model."
