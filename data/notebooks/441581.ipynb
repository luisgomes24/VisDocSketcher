    "# Shake-up or Shake-down?\n",
    "\n",
    "Everybody is talking about shake-up at this competition ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43144), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43315) ,[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43547), [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43336)). Here is my 2 cents. Let's try to estimate shake-up numericaly somehow. This notebook based on [nice exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/vpaslay/is-your-small-gini-significant) of how many samples should be guessed additionally to get an improvement of 0.001 of gini score and a [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/vpaslay/is-your-small-gini-significant#244525) below it. Another [interesting kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/alexfir/expected-gini-standard-error) on this topic estimated the standard error of simple model depending on test size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question I want to explore here is:\n",
    "- How much can be the **difference between public and private test score**?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use simple and naive method to estimate aforementioned difference depending on the public score. We do not have labels for test dataset, but we have train labels, so let's assume that our train set can represent test set. We will use OOF predictions of train set, split them randomly with a same proportion as public and private leaderboard split (private is **70%** of all test). (OOF predictions were taken from [notebook v 38](https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/xgboost-cv-lb-284), feature \"New kernel with this data\" didn't work as I expected and I couldn't read the data =( so downloaded and uploaded the validation predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "It should be noticed that here we assume several things:\n",
    "- Train and test datasets have similar class balances;\n",
    "- Difference of sample sizes of train and test can be ignored;\n",
    "- Generaly: OOF predictions of train set can represent test set."
