    "In soccer (or actual football), the idea of pitch control presented by Javier Fernandez and Luke Bornn in the 2019 paper \"Wide Open Spaces\" has become increasingly popular. [This post by Robert Hickman](https://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/fall_back_in_to_space/) does a great job of explaining how it works, and much of the work done for this model is based on [Will Thompson's work here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V75UgfJEfCWgbfxnG4OuB1WpvqahUJPU). \n",
    "Pitch control gives us a way to see what areas of the field a team has more 'influence' over, and in turn where a team should want the ball to be. Let's apply this idea in an NFL context to see how passes perform when thrown into areas of different influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use ball influence / pitch control as a feature in our model, along with the x y coordinates of the players and football, to predict if a pass play will be complete or not. Since we only have coverages for week 1, we'll use week 1 for our model for now. Once we have confirmed that ball influence is a significant feature in our model, we will average our influence values across the field and separate by coverage scheme to see if we can gain any insights into what areas of the field defenses are good/bad at covering."

    "These were the four most commonly used coverage schemes from week 1 of the 2018 season. In general it looks like the zone defenses are good at defending the areas in the middle of the field(areas of solid red). However, it appears that they give up control of the short field (flat routes) as most of the areas near the line of scrimmage have more blue. By comparison, Cover 1 Man doesn't have as much control over the center (not as 'red') but they do not give up as much control over the line of scrimmage (not as 'blue'). If we take a closer look at Cover 2 Zone, we can also see that there is a clear weakness (blue patches) around both sidelines about 20 yards from the line of scrimmage. This is likely a result of having only 2 players cover so much real estate - the defense will have less influence over areas near the boundaries of the coverage zones."

    "These were the four most commonly used coverage schemes from week 1 of the 2018 season. In general it looks like the zone defenses are good at defending the areas in the middle of the field(areas of solid red). However, it appears that they give up control of the short field (flat routes) as most of the areas near the line of scrimmage have more blue. By comparison, Cover 1 Man doesn't have as much control over the center (not as 'red') but they do not give up as much control over the line of scrimmage (not as 'blue'). If we take a closer look at Cover 2 Zone, we can also see that there is a clear weakness (blue patches) around both sidelines about 20 yards from the line of scrimmage. This is likely a result of having only 2 players cover so much real estate - the defense will have less influence over areas near the boundaries of the coverage zones.\n",

    "In the future, teams can use their own coverage and tracking data to analyze how their defenses perform in various schemes. They'll be able to make adjustments and plug their weaknesses as they identify areas on the field that they do not have good influence over.\n",
