    "#  An Introduction To MoleculeNet\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of DeepChem is that it comes \"batteries included\" with datasets to use. The DeepChem developer community maintains the MoleculeNet [1] suite of datasets which maintains a large collection of different scientific datasets for use in machine learning applications. The original MoleculeNet suite had 17 datasets mostly focused on molecular properties. Over the last several years, MoleculeNet has evolved into a broader collection of scientific datasets to facilitate the broad use and development of scientific machine learning tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are integrated with the rest of the DeepChem suite so you can conveniently access these these through functions in the `dc.molnet` submodule. You've already seen a few examples of these loaders already as you've worked through the tutorial series. The full documentation for the MoleculeNet suite is available in our docs [2].\n",
