    "Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death in both [Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/190530/dq190530c-eng.pdf?st=g0roC2Py) and the [USA](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282929.php#heart-disease). It can be influenced by a multitude of factors that are related to nutrition, environmental factors, lifestyle, and genetics. In this analysis we will explore some of the potential physiological indicators of heart disease and determine whether we can obtain a model that gives reliable predictions. \n",

    "Historically, women have been underepresented in clinical trials for [medical treatments](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Abstract/2019/05000/Systematic_Review_of_Gender_Bias_in_the_Clinical.15.aspx). In ways this has hurt female health because we are using research that is optimized for men and using that to treat the [physiolocigally different](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mars-vs-venus-the-gender-gap-in-health) female body. Instead it is perhaps more beneficial to analyze data for each sex independently. Based on this idea, we will explore models that train on features that are important to each sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other kernels associated with this dataset do a great job of exploring the data from a visual standpoint so I encourage you to check the other ones out and give them a thumbs up if you find them helpful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the goals for this analysis are as follows:\n",
    "2. explore using Altair, rather than seaborn \n",
    "3. a bonus would be to implement a heroku dashboard (unfinished)\n",
    "4. Obtain a model that is a good predictor of heart disease based on the features in this dataset \n",
    "5. Get insight into which features are the most important \n",
    "3. Should gender-focused models be considered when predicting on gender-specific data?\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, different models were constructed based on highest-correlated features for each gender. Overall, the RF model performed better than the XGBoost model, on both the test and hidden vault data. The main question asked was whether training a model on features important to a specific gender improved performance on gender-specific data, compared to a model trained on features important to both genders. The only case where an improvement was observed with the male-focused RF model which performed slightly better than the comprehensive model (~1%) on male-specific data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, both the female-focused RF and XG models performed worse on female-specific data, compared to both the comprehensive and male-focused models. One potential explanation for this is the small number of female observations in the vault data (53). The small sample size may not be sufficient to give a reliable accuracy score. It is also important to note that the correlations used were based on a subset the data and don't necessarily provide an accurate representation of the population data. In hindsight, it may have been better to separate the data first by gender and then split them into independent training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we explored potential differences in models constructed with a specific gender in mind. Perhaps, there is a better method of feature selection that could be implemented. Furthermore, more models could be explored along with their hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone has any comments or suggestions, I encourage you to voice them as I am always looking for feedback. If you enjoyed this study or learned something useful, I would appreciate an upvote. I may consider creating a heroku dashboard to visualize the heart disease data in the future (using plotly dash).\n",
