    "# Win Prediction Using Four-Factors\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, I will try to predict the number of wins for each basketball team from college basketball dataset using Dean Oliver's \"Four Factors of Basketball Success\". What is four factors? In simple words, for factors are four most important strategies to win a basketball game, as analyzed by Dean Oliver. The strategies are:\n",
    "1. Score Every Possession\n",
    "2. Pick Up All Rebounds\n",
    "3. Get to the Foul Line\n",
    "4. Protect the Basketball\n",
    "\n",
    "For the explanation of each strategies, I recommend you to read from various sports blog (such as this [blog](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/05/introduction-to-olivers-four-factors/) where I got those four strategies). In other words, those strategies can be represented in four stats: \n",
    "1. Effective field goals \n",
    "2. Turnovers percentage \n",
    "3. Rebounding percentage \n",
    "4. Free Throws rate \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noticed that, we must consider both offense and defense, as for example scoring many points does not enough to win the game, as we need to minimize the opponent scoring as well. Thus, we must consider 8 factors in total for both offense and defense:\n",
    "* Offensive Factors\n",
    "    * Effective Field Goal Percentage\n",
    "    * Percentage\n",
    "    * Offensive Rebound Percentage\n",
    "    * Free Throw Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defensive Factors\n",
    "    * Opponent’s Effective Field Goal Percentage\n",
    "    * Opponent’s Turnover Percentage\n",
    "    * Defensive Rebound Percentage\n",
    "    * Opponent’s Free Throw Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "(again thanks to the author of this [blog](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/05/introduction-to-olivers-four-factors/) for providing clear explanation)\n",
    "Luckily for us, the college basketball dataset has provided us all of the stats above to be played with. "

In the future, maybe I can improve my model by pre-processing the data to meet the linear regression assumption, and also using PCA to solve some dimensionality problem, or even using better machine learning method. All of the code minus some visualization can be found in my github: https://github.com/thomasoca. I still learn how to become a good data scientist, and I hope my first notebook does not dissapoint you all. Comments, advices, or anything else is acceptable."
