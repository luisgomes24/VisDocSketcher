    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) **is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics**, often **using statistical graphics** and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing. Exploratory data analysis **has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments**."
