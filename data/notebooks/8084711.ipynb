The purpose of setting the loss function is to find the minimum value of the loss function with the selected optimization method. The minimum loss assures that the model is optimal at that time. In the optimization solution, only the convex function can obtain the global minimum and the non-convex function tends to obtain the local optimum. In our case, the squared loss function, when used for logistic regression, will obtain a non-convex function, which means that global optimization will be missed in most of the cases.

A gradient is a vector that indicates that the direction derivative of a function takes the maximum along this direction at that point, i.e., the function changes the fastest along the direction of this gradient (changes with the highest rate of change). In short, for a unary function a gradient is the derivative at a certain point. For a multivariate function, a gradient is a vector of partial derivatives at a certain point."

    "In this chapter, we learned a classification method called logistic regression. Logistic regression is a very common and practical binary classification method that is often used in practical problems such as spam judgment. In addition, logistic regression can also work for multi-classification problems; but since we are going to learn other methods that are more dominant in those problems, we will not explain them here.
