    "\"The Brier Score, first proposed in the context of weather forecasting by the statistician Glenn Brier in 1950, gives us a precise measure of the degree of accuracy of the predictions. For each possible outcome and forecast, the Brier Score calculates the squared value of the difference, which lies between 0 (100% accurate) and 1 (100% inaccurate). Thus we have a score for each outcome (row) in our data. The Brier Score for the forecasts is the average of the rows.\"\n",

    "\"In the NBA, MLB, and IPL data we have two possible outcomes for each team in each game - win or lose. In the NHL and EPL data we have three possible outcomes for each team in each game - win, lose, or tie/draw.\""
