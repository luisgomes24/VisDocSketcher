    "\n",
    "- This survey received 19,717 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for anonymity.\n",
    "- Most of the respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, like our email list, discussion forums and social media channels.\n",
    "- The survey was live from October 8th to October 28th. We allowed respondents to complete the survey at any time during that window. \n",
    "- Not every question was shown to every respondent. In general, respondents with more experience were asked more questions and respondents with less experience were asked less questions.\n",
    "- To protect the respondents’ identity, the answers to multiple choice questions have been separated into a separate data file from the open-ended responses. \n",
    "- Multiple choice single response questions fit into individual columns whereas multiple choice multiple response questions were split into multiple columns.\n",
    "- Text responses were encoded to protect user privacy and countries with fewer than 50 respondents were grouped into the category \"other\".\n",
