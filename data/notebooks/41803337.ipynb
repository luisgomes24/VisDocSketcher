    "# Summary and Key Takeaway\n",
    "Taking the Ash false color image as a basis seems great, but I expect most people are doing that already.\n",
    "Just adding bands 11 to 16 to that base seems like a bad idea, as the information is almost completely contained in blue already.\n",
    "I would recommend trying to add band08 as a 4th input channel (normalized), as it is much less correlated with the Ash colors and pretty well correlated with the contrails, meaning it could add new and useful information, an implementation is here [Contrails Dataset (Ash+08)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raki21/contrails-dataset-ash-band08-with-soft-mask). I would not add all 3 (bands 08,09 and 10) as they are highly correlated with each other and additional channels that don't contribute additional information might increase opportunity for overfitting.

    "# Information Bands\n",
    "A lot of information about bands is already contained in other EDAs, especially [this EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pranavnadimpali/comprehensive-eda-submission), a short summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is a key instrument on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series. It captures images of the Earth using 16 spectral bands, with each band focusing on a specific wavelength. This provides a wealth of information about the Earth's atmosphere, clouds, land, and water, significantly improving weather analysis and forecasting. In this dataset, you have access to 9 bands for each example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each band provides a series of images taken at 10-minute intervals, leading to 8 images for each band spanning 80 minutes. This temporal data captures how contrails evolve over time. Two types of segmentation masks are provided: 'human_pixel_masks' that represent the consolidated ground truth, and 'human_individual_masks' that represent annotations from multiple labellers. The ground truth corresponds to the 5th image in the bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image that labellers annotate is a false color image, which is not directly provided in the spectral bands but can be generated from them. The false color image uses the [Ash color scheme](https://eumetrain.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/RGB_recipes.pdf), using bands 15,14 and 11, making contrails appear darker and thus easier to detect. The ash color scheme combines red, green, and blue channels to represent different features. \n"
