    "<p>Hey and welcome to my notebook. Not trivial for me and I hope not trivial for the community. I want to introduce you my todays code dedicated to <mark>response time of Kaggle</mark>, the place we love so much. I made <mark>100 requests for the main Kaggle pages and write down all the response times into dataset</mark>. At the very end you will see these datasset, which you can use as you wish. Also, I added <mark>3 seconds time sleep</mark> in order to be ignored by servers. So, have a nice reading and exploration. Hope it will be at leat curious for you!</p>"
