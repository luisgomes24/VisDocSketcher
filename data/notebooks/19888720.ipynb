    " Like probably many of you, I was *very* surprised when I saw the final results this morning. As the discussion [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/266385) has shown, the key to the large distance between the winning solution and #2 was what the winning team called \"magic #2\". This method allowed them to remove background noise completely for at least some samples. Achieving this would be a kind of Holy Grail for experimental physics, so I really wanted to understand this method. At first, I couldn't wrap my head aroungd their explanation, so I started to reimplement it on my own.\n",
    " \n",
    "DISCLAIMER: even though I think that in the end it is some kind of leak, the winning team's solution is absolutely brilliant. I would have never figured this out on my own. And of course, I'm not 100% sure that this is all there is to \"magic #2\". This is just my attempt at an explanation.\n",
    " \n",
    "By now, the following is clear to me:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that the true measured background signals used in this competition are far wider in the frequency range than 256 bins. Therefore, the organizers cut the data up into bands of 256 bins each and used these as samples. However, for reasons unclear to me they user *severely* overlapping samples. Therefore, for most samples in the datasets, you can -partially- find that data again in another sample. If one of them contains a needle, you can perfectly remove any noise.\n",
    "The only remaining problem is the fact that each image in a sample is independently normalized to mean=0, std=1. This needs to be reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will demonstrate this for one sample:"
