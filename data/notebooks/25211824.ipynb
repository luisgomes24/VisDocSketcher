    "# What is a scatter plot?\n",
    "A scatter plot (Chambers 1983) reveals relationships or association between two variables. The relationship between two variables is called correlation. A scatter plot usually consists of a large body of data. The closer the data points come when plotted to making a straight line, the higher the correlation between the two variables, or the stronger the relationship. If the data points make a straight line going from the origin out to high x- and y-values, then the variables are said to have a positive correlation. If the line goes from a high-value on the y-axis down to a high-value on the x-axis, the variables have a negative correlation."

    "# Common issues when using scatter plots\n",

    "\n",
    "* Overplotting <br>\n",
    "When we have lots of data points to plot, this can run into the issue of overplotting. Overplotting is the case where data points overlap to a degree where we have difficulty seeing relationships between points and variables. It can be difficult to tell how densely-packed data points are when many of them are in a small area.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**<br>\n",
    "There are a few common ways to alleviate this issue. One alternative is to sample only a subset of data points: a random selection of points should still give the general idea of the patterns in the full data. We can also change the form of the dots, adding transparency to allow for overlaps to be visible, or reducing point size so that fewer overlaps occur. As a third option, we might even choose a different chart type like the heatmap, where color indicates the number of points in each bin. Heatmaps in this use case are also known as 2-d histograms.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreting correlation as causation <br>\n",
    "This is not so much an issue with creating a scatter plot as it is an issue with its interpretation. Simply because we observe a relationship between two variables in a scatter plot, it does not mean that changes in one variable are responsible for changes in the other. This gives rise to the common phrase in statistics that correlation does not imply causation. It is possible that the observed relationship is driven by some third variable that affects both of the plotted variables, that the causal link is reversed, or that the pattern is simply coincidental."
