    "Peru has to deal with an exponential increase in the number of dead and infected, after the end of a mandatory national quarantine. Today, the country is the second in the region with the most cases (395 thousand) and deaths (18,612), behind only Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prolonged confinement,  which started in mid-March, after the first reported case - was a blow to the economy of a country that, before the pandemic, had been growing above the Latin American average. GDP fell 17 per cent in the first five months of the year and more than 2.6 million jobs were lost, according to official data. Among the factors that explain the sharp drop is the high rate of informality, which reaches 70 per cent - and led to strong pressure to end the quarantine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level of informality, which led many young people to work on the streets despite the confinement, a number of other factors, such as the precarious health system and disinformation, contributed to the worsening of the health crisis in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic has reinforced structural health problems. There is a historic gap in the primary care system that cannot be resolved in four months. In addition, one in five households in the countryside lack basic services, such as water. In addition to the high level of informal work, especially among young people, the high displacement of workers helped to spread the pandemic, with the creation of so-called risk corridors. https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/suplica-de-mulher-presidente-peruano-vira-simbolo-do-avanco-da-pandemia-no-pais-24556588&prev=search&pto=aue"
