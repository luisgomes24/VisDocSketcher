    "# Closing price fluctuations \n",
    "Using the graph functions in pandas, the yearly average closing prices can be plotted. It reveals that until the recession of in 2008, the prices for all three manufactures were rising. However, following the crash, for approx. 4 years the stock prices remained low. \n",
    "\n",
    "From 2012, the prices recorded a steady increase. For 2 manufactures, KHI and IHI, this lead to their stocks recording a higher price in 2015 out performing the highs before the financial crash. Based solely on this data, a definite conclusion on the cause of the increased stock price cannot be reached. It may be the global economic recovery but Abenomics lead by the prime minister of Japan was also introduced in 2012([Kenton, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/abenomics.asp#:~:text=Abenomics%20is%20the%20nickname%20for,the%20Japanese%20economy%20more%20competitive.)). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a decline in the prices in 2015. Whilst it was not significant as the 2008 recession, reports indicate that there was a mini recession from 2015 to 2016 ([New York Times, 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/upshot/mini-recession-2016-little-known-big-impact.html)) ([Forbes, 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcarlson/2020/02/24/are-we-repeating-2015-2016-in-the-economy-and-investment-markets/)). The impact of COVID can also be observed in the closing price fluctuations for 2020 with prices falling to levels similar to 2008 but slowly recovering in 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the most recent records for KHI appears to show a dip in the stock prices. Once again, based on solely this dataset, it is difficult to understand the possible causes. However, one possibility may be their portfolio and the ongoing economic uncertainty. For instance, KHI are involved in the production of TRENT XWB engines used in the Airbus A350 ([KHI, 2011](https://global.kawasaki.com/en/corp/newsroom/news/detail/20110323_1.html)). Such planes are designed for long haul flights ([Airbus,2022](https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/commercial-aircraft/passenger-aircraft/a350-family)), which have struggled to recover since COVID due to a myriad of factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "An updated version of the graph with monthly averages rather than yearly average that there is significant fluctuations. Additionally, whilst this was not clear in the yearly version, in 2018, stock prices of  particularly IHI temporarily outperformed that of MHI which had consistently outperformed the two other manufactures. In fact, since 2015, MHI stocks appear to have been suffering. One factor for this may be issues with some of the some of their projects including the AIDAprima which was delayed ([Seatrade Cruise News, 2016](https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news-headlines/mitsubishi-heavy-industries-breaks-silence-problems-its-cruise-newbuild-contracts)).

For IHI and KHI, they were able to recover in approx. 4.5-5 years. Also, for these companies at the very least, their stock prices had begun to decrease in 2007, a year or so before the collapse of Lemon Brothers ([Lioudis, 2021](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/lehman-brothers-collapse.asp)).
