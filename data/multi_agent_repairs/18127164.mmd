    %% A & A1 are the train and test CSV files used as data sources.
    %% B & C represent loaded DataFrames after reading CSVs.
    %% B1, C1 are prepared DataFrames after dropping unnecessary columns.
    %% D is the list of features used across train & test sets.
    %% E, F, G represents the train features, train target, and test features.
    %% H is the trained Logistic Regression model.
    %% I represents the predictions made by the model.
    %% J shows the model being saved as a Pickle file.
