2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Unzipped training and testing datasets from CSV files.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load DataFrame from CSV.
   - Shuffle and prepare features and labels for training.
   - Resample to handle class imbalance.
   - Create input arrays suitable for BERT input format.

4. **Model Definition**:
   - Use BERT model as the base.
   - Add multi-label output layer with a custom recall metric and binary cross-entropy loss.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Fit model using training inputs and labels, specifying epochs and batch size.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Predict toxicity on test data and evaluate metrics such as Hamming loss and recall.

7. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove unnecessary CSV files after training and evaluation.
