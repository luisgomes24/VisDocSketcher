# Build an End2End baseline REAL FAST with fastai

---

## Summary
The notebook presents a baseline model using fastai to predict 'Pawpularity' from pet images in a regression task. 

### Key Components:
- **Data Sources**: 
  - training and testing image metadata are loaded and utilized.
- **Data Processing**: 
  - The notebook leverages fastai's DataBlock for creating dataloaders without needing explicit definitions.
- **Model Training**: 
  - A convolutional neural network based on ResNet18 is used for fine-tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: 
  - Predictions are made on a test dataset and prepared for submission.
