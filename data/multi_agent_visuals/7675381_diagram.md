# Data Sources
- Directory: `/kaggle/input/flowers-recognition/flowers/flowers`
  - Contains flower images organized into subdirectories by class.

# Data Variables
- `STORAGE_CLIENT`: GCS storage client to interact with Google Cloud Storage.
- `WORKING_DIRECTORY`: Directory for saving TFRecord files.
- `BASE_DIR`: Base directory for the flower images dataset.
- `FILE_PATTERN`: Pattern matching jpg files in the base directory.
- `TARGET_SIZE`: Target size for resizing images.
- `CLASSES`: List of class names from the subdirectory names.
- `AUTO`: Auto tuning for parallel calls in TF data. 
- `SHARDS`: Number of shards for TFRecords.

# Data Flow
1. **`dataset1`** created by **mapping** `filenames` to **decode_jpeg_and_label** and flows to **dataset2**.
2. **`dataset2`** created by **mapping** `dataset1` to **resize_and_crop_image** and flows to **dataset3**.
3. **`dataset3`** created by **mapping** `dataset2` to **recompress_image** and flows to **TFRecord writing**.
4. **`dataset4`** is created by **listing files** in the WORKING_DIRECTORY and flows to **model training or validation**.

# Models
- **TPU-based model**
  - Input Features: Images in TFRecord format
  - Target Variable: Class labels
