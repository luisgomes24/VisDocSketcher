# Data Science Workflow Diagram for 16094539

## Data Sources
- **Training Data**: Training dataset containing features and risk flags.
- **Test Data**: Dataset for prediction, with risk flags initialized to -99.

## Data Variables
- `train`: DataFrame containing training data loaded from a CSV file.
- `test`: DataFrame containing test data loaded from a CSV file.
- `data`: A combined DataFrame of `train` and `test` data.
- `data_y`: The target variable (risk_flag) extracted from `data`.
- `X`: Features extracted from `train` for model training.
- `Y`: Target variable for model training.
- `oversample`: Resampling strategy for handling class imbalance.

## Data Flow
1. Read training and test data from CSV files.
2. Concatenate training and test data into `data`.
3. Extract `risk_flag` from `data` into `data_y`, and drop it from `data`.
4. Split `data` into `train` and `test` sets based on `risk_flag` values.
5. Resample the `train` set to balance classes using `RandomUnderSampler`.
6. Split `train` into train and validation sets (`X1`, `Y1` for training; `X2`, `Y2` for validation).
7. Train a `RandomForestClassifier` using features (`X`) and target (`Y`).
8. Predict on the test set and prepare submission file.

## Models
- **RandomForestClassifier**: Used with features `X` to predict `Y`. Hyperparameters include `random_state=0` and `oob_score=True`.
