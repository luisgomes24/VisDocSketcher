## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two datasets, focusing on visualizing distributions, relationships, and correlations within the data. It uses various plotting functions to achieve this.

## Data Sources
1. **TAT_Prediction_Test_Version_61_Min_400_03_12_2019_25_11_to_03_12_With_Cyclic_and_rounding_revised.csv**
   - Test dataset to evaluate predictions about time above threshold.
2. **TAT_Prediction_Train_Version_61_Min_400_03_12_2019_03_05_to_24_11_With_Cyclic_and_rounding_revised.csv**
   - Training dataset containing features used for predictions.

## Data Variables
- **df1**: DataFrame for the test dataset, generated from the first CSV file.
- **df2**: DataFrame for the training dataset, generated from the second CSV file.

## Data Flow
- **df1**:
   - Created using `pd.read_csv()`.
   - Used in various plots (distribution, correlation matrix, scatter plots).
- **df2**:
   - Created using `pd.read_csv()`.
   - Used in similar visualizations as df1.

## Models
No predictive models are implemented in this notebook; the focus is on exploratory data analysis.
