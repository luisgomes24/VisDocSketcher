# Analysis Summary Workflow

- **Input Dataset**: Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) is loaded as a pandas DataFrame (`data`).
- **Data Cleaning**: Irrelevant columns are dropped, and missing values are filled with the most frequent values.
- **Outlier Detection**: Four methods are introduced: Visualization (Boxplot and Histogram), Skewness, Interquartile Range (IQR), and Standard Deviation.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Outliers are treated using flooring/capping and trimming methods.
- **Visualization**: Many visualizations are produced to illustrate data quality and outlier presence, including heatmaps and boxplots.
- **Statistical Insights**: Insights on variable skewness and its implications on data integrity are consolidated.
