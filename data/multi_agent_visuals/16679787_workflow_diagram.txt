# Workflow Diagram for the Notebook 16679787

1. **Data Source**: Insurance dataset containing simulated beneficiary data and charges.
2. **Data Loading**: Use of get_data() from PyCaret to load the insurance data.
3. **Model Setup**: Creating a regression setup in PyCaret to predict charges.
4. **Model Creation**: Implementing and tuning Random Forest model to improve accuracy.
5. **Model Comparison**: Comparing multiple models to find the best performing ones.
6. **Model Blending**: Blending tuned models to create a stronger predictive model.
7. **Model Finalization**: Finalizing and saving the combined model for deployment.
8. **Prediction Function**: Using the final model to predict health insurance costs based on input parameters.
